Like Tic-Tac-Toe, there is a 3x3 board and two players, X and O.

The Board is initialized as empty, without either X's or O's on it.

The first player is X.
On each turn, the current player rolls a single die. The number on the die is the number he can place on the board, along with his symbol.
If a cell is empty, any player can lay claim to it -> 
    For example, if an empty cell is claimed by X, after he rolled a 3, the Cell will display X with a value of 3.
If a cell is claimed:
- If its number is 6, it cannot be changed any further.
- If its number is below 6, there are two scenarios:
1. The player of the same symbol can add further numbers he has rolled to it ->
    For example, if the cell had the symbol O with a number of 2, and the player O has rolled a 3, he can add to the cell, totalling 5.
                In the same situation, if the player rolled a 5, he can add to the 2, but that will result in 6, being the maximum possible value for a cell.
2. The player of the opposite symbol can conquer a cell by rolling a higher number than what is currently in the cell ->
    For example, if the cell had the symbol X with a number 3, and the Player O rolled a 4, he can take over the cell, and the final cell will have the symbol O with a value of 4.

A victor is decided based on rows, columns, and diagonals, but only when all the relevant cells have a value of 6 ->
    For example, if there is a row of X's, but the middle X has a value of 5, this is not a winning row.
     If the row has the same symbol, and all of them have a value of six, the game ends and that symbol's player is declared the winner.
