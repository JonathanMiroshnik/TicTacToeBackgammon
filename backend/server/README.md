The server directory follows a common Node.js/TypeScript backend structure with clear separation of concerns:

1. Root files:
- .env: Environment variables
- .gitignore: Git ignore rules
- package*.json: Project dependencies and config
- tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration

2. src/ directory (main application code):
- app.ts: Likely the main Express app configuration
- index.ts: Entry point that starts the server
- controllers/: Business logic handlers (currently only userController.ts)
- routes/: API route definitions (currently only userRoutes.ts)
- services/: Business logic/services (currently only userServices.ts)
- types/: Type definitions (currently only user.d.ts)

3. The structure suggests a clean MVC-like pattern where:
- Routes define endpoints and call controllers
- Controllers handle requests/responses and call services
- Services contain core business logic
- Types define shared interfaces
